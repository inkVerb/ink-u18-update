# Legacy version, no longer in development

This is a legacy version meant to run on Ubuntu 18.04. Development did not continue in Ubuntu 20.04 where `snap` was overriding `apt` and `apt-get` installer package commands. In January 2021, development moved to Arch and Manjaro frameworks. That project is available at the former repo for this original project: [inkVerb/ink-update](https://github.com/inkVerb/ink-update).
